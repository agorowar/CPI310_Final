        <h3><i>Purpose of Project</i></h3>
        <p>Providing your animal with adequate enrichment can be a monumental task. Social animals in single pet households can find themselves pent up, lonely, and full of energy. Our solution is simple: a 'dating app' for pets, allowing pet owners to connect themselves with other pet owners based on their pets personality, breed, and temperment. Many of the pet owners in our group have encountered this problem with our own pets, and understand the struggles of responsible pet raising. On top of the 'swipe' function for playdates, we 
            also understand the difficulties of suddenly having an animal sprung onto you-- Paw Me Maybe will also supply pet owners with 'profiles', and allow people trying to <i>adopt out</i> an animal easily match with a responsible owner trying to <i>adopt in.</i> <i>Paw Me Maybe</i> is the solution we need for the problems of today!  </p>

        <h3><i>User Case Analysis</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A pet owner creates an account on Paw Me Maybe, inputting their personal information and creating a Pet Owner profile. They click the 'new pet' button, which creates a new pet profile. They input the breed (Boston Terrier), and choose relevant personality and breed tags, uploading a picture and a small pet profile. They and their pet have been entered into the system.</li>
            <li>The owner of a Bernese Shepard is looking for another large dog for their pet to play with. They open the application, and set their preferences-- a large dog, with a calm personality, and low energy. They begin to swipe through other pets until they settle on another Bernese Shepard, suggested to the pet owner based on their preferences. They swipe right, and begin a chat with the other Pet owner.</li>
            <li>A user who has recently come into the posesssion of a litter of Kittens opens their own profile, clicking the 'adopt out' button, and creates an 'ad blurb' for their adoptable cat: a kitten of unknown breed, spayed, with all of it's shots. This is posted onto the adoptables page. Shortly after, they recieve a notification on their profile splash page: somebody interested in the cat has sent them a message.</li>
            <li>A user is looking to adopt another cat. They open the 'Adoption' splash page and scroll through the available animals, settling on a cat of unknown breed that is spayed, with all of it's vaccinations. Selecting the ad blurb, they are given the option to open a chat with the current owner of the animal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Database Design</i></h3>
        <p>The Database is going to be created using MySQL, with seperate charts for <i>Users</i> and <i>Pets</i>. Each chart object will be relevantly tagged with sub-charts as neccesary.</p>
